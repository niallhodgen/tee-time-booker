# tee-time-booker
An experimental program to automate tee time booking at my local golf club using BRS Golf's API.

Booking tee times has become notoriously difficult since COVID. Tee times are released at 7pm 14 days in advance and they fill up within 5 min of opening, especially for important competitions. The aim of this program is to automate that process and trigger API calls to book times as soon as booking opens.
